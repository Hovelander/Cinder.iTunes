Cinder.iTunes
============

iTunes iOS MediaPlayer CinderBlock for the creative coding library, Cinder.  (https://forum.libcinder.org/#Forum/cinderblocks) 

Cruelly ripped from proud Papi Seph14, who partially developed on top of bloom time's awesome "CinderIPod" CinderBlock (https://github.com/notlion/CinderIPod).
